# Node Package Manager

We Learned in previous lessons, how to export/import codes from different modules, but these modules are our mine, how can get benefit of this and use modules for other people to make production fast? by **NPM**

## NPM

**NPM** is a package manager, you can install modules of other people in its registey that contains a tons of packages of code you can use them in your project

like if you want logarithm function to use there are some people created packages called `Math` inside this package exports a tons of functions you can use in your project.

### Dependencies

**Dependencies** are deps that your code and production depend on them, without existance your project won't work.

**Dev Dependencies** they deps used in your project ok, but you don't need them in production, you may remove them in production
